# LOLChampions

This is League of Legneds login screen App.
First screen when you start this app is log in screen.
There is a video and you can stop the video by touching the screen.
If you do not have credential, hit signup button to register.
It atcually scores username and password into the database (sqlite3).
Once you sign in, you will see the second screen with another video.
Second video contains media controller you can bring it up by tapping the screen.
There are two buttons are only available (CHAMP INFO and COLLECTION buttons).

For CHAMP INFO, I used the recycler view, card view and constraint view.
When you touch any row, it will bring you to another activity called campion information.
Champion informaiton screen plays YouTube video for each champion's spotlight.

I am still working on this project and try to find the best way to store all the data.
